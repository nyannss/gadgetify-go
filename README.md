## Overview

This project provides a RESTful API for managing products in an online gadget shop. It supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products.

The REST API follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), which enables easy integration with various clients, including web and mobile applications. It utilizes the HTTP protocol for communication, allowing clients to perform operations such as retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting resources.

### Features

- Authorization & Authentication
- Upload Images
- CRUD
- Error Handling & Validation
